//   use of the nodemon is that it reduce our effort
// when ever we make modification to our code ever time we have 
// run the code by running command "npm ./server.js" whenever u make modification 


//   To get rid of this problem we use nodemon 
//  to install it we run command "npm i nodemon"
const colors = require('colors');
console.log("hello abhishek2".red);
console.log("hello abhishek2".blue);

//  to run this we give command instead of "npm ./server.js" -> "nodemon ./server.js"
